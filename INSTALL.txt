INSTALLATION
------------

Decompress the print-n.x-n.n.tar.gz file into your Drupal modules
directory (usually sites/all/modules, see http://drupal.org/node/176044 for
more information).

Enable the print module: Administer > Site building > Modules
  (admin/build/modules)

PDF TOOL
--------

The print_pdf module requires the use of an external PDF generation tool.
The currently supported tools are dompdf and TCPDF.

dompdf support:
  The dompdf tool produces results that are more faithful to the HTML
  printer-friendly page.

  1. Download dompdf from http://sourceforge.net/projects/dompdf/
  2. Extract the contents of the downloaded package into the print module
  directory (usually sites/all/modules/print)
  3. Edit dompdf_config.inc.php to fit your installation.
  4. Grant write access to the lib/fonts directory to your webserver user.
  5. If you're using dompdf-0.5.1, delete the dompdf.php file as it contains
  a security vulnerability
  6. Check http://www.digitaljunkies.ca/dompdf/ for further information.

TCPDF support:
  TCPDF seems to be more actively developed than dompdf, but it's support
  for CSS is considerably worse.

  1. Download TCPDF from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpdf/
  2. Extract the contents of the downloaded package into the print module
  directory (usually sites/all/modules/print)
  3. Check http://tcpdf.sourceforge.net/ for further information.

UPDATE
------

When updating from a previous version, just remove the print directory and
follow the instructions above. Make sure that you backup any costumization
to the print.tpl.php and print.css files.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Configure access rules: Administer > User management > Access control
  (admin/user/access)
 access print: Enable access to the PF page and display of the PF link in
               other pages. (default: disabled) 
 administer print: Enable access to the module settings page. 
                   (default: disabled)

Configure the module: Administer > Site configuration > Printer-friendly
    (admin/settings/print)

ROBOTS
------

Even though it is possible to set per-page robots settings, the following
can be placed in your robots.txt file after the User-agent line to prevent
search engines from even asking for the page:

Disallow: /print/

Also, for updates from older versions (<=4.7.x-1.0 and <=5.x-1.2) which used
node/nnn/print instead of print/nnn, the following lines can prevent
requests from Google for the obsolete print URLs:

Disallow: /*/print$

Note that pattern matching in robots.txt is a Google extension (see
http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=40367 for more
information).
