INSTALLATION
------------

Decompress the print-n.x-n.n.tar.gz file into your Drupal modules
directory (usually sites/all/modules, see http://drupal.org/node/176044 for
more information).

Enable the print module: Administer > Site building > Modules
  (admin/build/modules)

UPDATE
------

When updating from a previous version, just remove the print directory and
follow the instructions above. Make sure that you backup any costumization
to the print.tpl.php and print.css files.

ROBOTS
------

Even though it is possible to set per-page robots settings, the following
can be placed in your robots.txt file after the User-agent line to prevent
search engines from even asking for the page:

Disallow: /print/

Also, for updates from older versions (<=4.7.x-1.0 and <=5.x-1.2) which used
node/nnn/print instead of print/nnn, the following lines can prevent
requests from Google for the obsolete print URLs:

Disallow: /*/print$

Note that pattern matching in robots.txt is a Google extension (see
http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=40367 for more
information).
